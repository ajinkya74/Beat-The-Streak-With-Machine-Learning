# Beat-The-Streak-With-Machine-Learning
Two one-class support vector machines with nonlinear kernels are used to choose batters for the purpose of winning MLB.com’s game ‘Beat the Streak’. The learning machines are trained and tested on historical data from 2010-2016, and the probability of success of the learning machine is shown to exceed that of choosing batters with uniform probability. From the performance on historical data, an expected value of the longest streak is estimated.
